 Visualization of Element Shaman Haste Values
 
 Python library that runs DPS simulations for various fixed Wrath of the Lich King Elemental Shaman sets (e.g. Phase 1 BiS), with variable Haste rating subtracted or added.
 
 The intent is to show significant variation in the value of Haste, to an extent that significantly impacts the relative value of pieces of gear.
